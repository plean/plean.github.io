Hi,

I'm a French student soon to be graduate, I have a NCSC-certified Msc in Cybersecurity (University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom) and will have a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology (Epitech, Paris Graduate School of Digital Innovation, France).

I have one year and a half of experience in the industry. I gathered that experience during three internships:
- [Hoomano](https://hoomano.com/), where I was coding behavior apps for robots and
- [Sandblock](https://sandblock.io/), where I was web developer
- [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/), where I was creating content for educational purpose in cybersecurity

All of them lasted 6 months.

I started cybersecurity and more particularly reverse engineering about 3 years ago, during those years I learnt from sites such as [rootme](https://www.root-me.org/planch_j?inc=score), then later by participating in various CTFs.

Among these CTF's, I distinguished myself during some of them:
- Hack Dat Kiwi 2017   - [2nd in Reverse exploit](http://2017.hack.dat.kiwi/)
- Pwn2Win CTF 2017     - [7th overall](https://ctf-br.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Captura-de-tela-de-2017-10-26-082330.png)
- Takoma Park CTF 2017 - [15th overall](https://ctftime.org/event/535)
- Inshack 2019	       - 3rd onsite
- Follow the Rabbit    - [1st overall](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENc2jC-XsAAeUwm?format=png&name=900x900)
- Sigsegv2 Final       - [7th overall](https://i.imgur.com/IGpeg9F.pngz)
